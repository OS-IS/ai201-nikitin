| 1          | Data Request      | Tampering               | An adversary can deface the target web application by injecting malicious code or uploading dangerous files                                 | Website defacement is an attack on a website where the attacker changes the visual appearance of the site or a webpage.          |
| 2          | Data Request      | Spoofing                | An adversary can get access to a user's session due to improper logout and timeout                                  | The session cookies is the identifier by which the server knows the identity of current user for each incoming request. If the attacker is able to steal the user token he would be able to access all user data and perform all actions on behalf of user.         |           
| 3          | Data query        | Repudiation             | An adversary can deny actions performed on Database MYSQL Server 2 due to a lack of auditing.                                  | An adversary can deny actions performed on Database MYSQL Server 2 due to a lack of auditing.         |
| 4          | Data query        | Information Disclosure  | An adversary can read confidential data due to weak connection string configuration.                                  | An adversary can read confidential data due to weak connection string configuration.         |
| 5          | Retrieved data    | Tampering               | An adversary can gain access to sensitive data by performing SQL injection through Web App                                 | SQL injection is an attack in which malicious code is inserted into strings that are later passed to an instance of SQL Server for parsing and execution. The primary form of SQL injection consists of direct insertion of code into user-input variables that are concatenated with SQL commands and executed. A less direct attack injects malicious code into strings that are destined for storage in a table or as metadata. When the stored strings are subsequently concatenated into a dynamic SQL command, the malicious code is executed.          |
| 6          | Data Request      | Spoofing                | An adversary can get access to a user's session due to insecure coding practices                                  | The session cookies is the identifier by which the server knows the identity of current user for each incoming request. If the attacker is able to steal the user token he would be able to access all user data and perform all actions on behalf of user.         |
| 7          | Retrieved data    | Repudiation             | Attacker can deny the malicious act and remove the attack foot prints leading to repudiation issues                                 | Proper logging of all security events and user actions builds traceability in a system and denies any possible repudiation issues. In the absence of proper auditing and logging controls, it would become impossible to implement any accountability in a system         |
| 8          | Data Request      | Tampering               | An adversary can gain access to sensitive data stored in Web App's config files                                  | An adversary can gain access to the config files. and if sensitive data is stored in it, it would be compromised.          |
| 9          | Retrieved data    | Information Disclosure  | An adversary can reverse weakly encrypted or hashed content                                 | An adversary can reverse weakly encrypted or hashed content         |
| 10         | Retrieved data    | Spoofing                | An adversary can create a fake website and launch phishing attacks                                  | An adversary can create a fake website and launch phishing attacks         |
